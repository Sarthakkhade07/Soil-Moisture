# Multi-Model Soil Moisture Prediction using Spatiotemporal Regression Techniques in MATLAB
Implemented a multi-model soil moisture forecasting system using real-world spatiotemporal and soil composition data. Developed three models: (1) a baseline model using k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) on raw features; (2) an ARX-based model leveraging lagged output and delayed input features to capture temporal patterns, followed by localized KNN-GPR; and (3) an optimized PCA-ARX model that reduced feature dimensionality while retaining 98% variance, enabling efficient GPR-based predictions. Evaluated models using RÂ² and RMSE, achieving high prediction accuracy and demonstrating the effectiveness of combining time series modeling, dimensionality reduction, and non-parametric regression techniques.
